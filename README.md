Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! 
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X and O. 
The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
